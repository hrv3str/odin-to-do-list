## Getting Started

You can use the app by following this link: [Odin To Do List](https://hrv3str.github.io/odin-to-do-list/).

When the page loads, you'll see an aside with buttons for Home, Projects, and Notes. These buttons lead to dropdown menus:

- **Home**: Contains Inbox (with an "Add Task" button), Today (tasks due today), and This Week (tasks due this week).
- **Projects**: Contains an "Add Project" button and labels for your projects. Click on a label to view the tasks within that project, and use the buttons to edit or delete the project.
- **Notes**: Displays notes labels. Click on a label to view and manage your notes.

Labels for notes and tasks provide options to edit, delete, and view details. For tasks, there's also a priority indicator and a button to mark tasks as complete.

Creating and editing tasks and notes is done through dialogues that gather the necessary information.

## Usage
